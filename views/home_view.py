    **Actionsheets** is an open-source (hobby) project with a different take on cheatsheets. 
    Standard cheatsheets are great for getting started, but don't get into the details for advanced or complex use cases.
    This is where actionsheets come in.
    
    #### Getting started
    Use the sidebar to select a programming language, and then select or search an actionsheets. 
    Sheets can be searched to generate a filtered view of code snippets.
    
    
    #### How do actionsheets differ from cheatsheets?
    - Actionsheets are expressed in terms of a desired *action* or result, and the code snippet(s) to achieve it.
      - This is a more natural way to look up code snippets. Especially useful for beginners.
    - Actions may be complex or comprise multiple steps.
      - Actions are not limited to the direct functionality provided by the package API. 
      - Cheatsheets typically lack more advanced compound use cases.
    - Code snippets are data; enabling dynamic generation of sheets depending on user queries
      - Sheets can therefore be more feature-complete, as they do not need fit on a single page.
        
    This way of organizing sheets is especially useful for packages or functions with powerful versatile functionality, where merely listing the API does not cover the full capabilities. 
    
    #### Contributing
    This website is a front-end for the [actionsheets](https://github.com/niekdt/actionsheets) package.
    Actionsheets are defined using [TOML](https://toml.io/) files. 
    This makes it very easy to define a hierarchy of code snippets in a readable way.
    
    Defining a code snippet belonging to the _Create_ section of the respective actionsheet file is as simple as:
    ```toml
    [create.list]
    action = "Define a list"
    code = "x = ['apple', 'pear', 'banana']"
    details = "You can define as many items as you like"
    ```
    
    For submitting code snippets or complete actionsheets, submit a PR to [actionsheets on Github](https://github.com/niekdt/actionsheets).
    
    #### Motivation
    My motivation for building this curated database of code snippet is out of frustration of the worsening state of the internet in quickly finding short answers to straightforward queries.
    
    - Many website have the code snippet(s) buried between tons of irrelevant text just for SEO optimization.
    - The quality of (accepted) answers on Stackoverflow is severely lacking for some programming languages:
      - Answers are out of date
      - Answers are overly complicated or inefficient (contributions by beginners)
      - For the future, this also means that the answers by any LLM are going to have the same issues. 
    - The answer on the site was for a different question
    - The answer on the site was for a more narrow question
    - With the increasing usage of LLMs, the problem of bloated low-quality answer results will only get worse.
